# Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Status âœ…
Your Sales Management System is successfully deployed on Railway! The logs you're seeing indicate normal startup.

## What the Logs Mean
- **"Starting Container"** - Railway is initializing your app
- **"npm warn config production"** - Just a deprecation notice (not an error)
- **"node api/index.js"** - Your server is starting correctly

## Railway Configuration Files Added

### 1. `railway.json`
- Configures Railway-specific settings
- Sets health check endpoint
- Defines restart policies

### 2. `nixpacks.toml`
- Optimizes build process for Railway
- Uses `--omit=dev` to fix the npm warning
- Builds frontend during deployment

### 3. Updated `api/index.js`
- Now properly starts server on Railway
- Uses Railway's PORT environment variable
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` for Railway compatibility

## Environment Variables Needed

Set these in Railway's dashboard:

### Required
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database_name
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
```

### Optional (for full functionality)
```
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-key
R2_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket-name.your-domain.com
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Testing Your Deployment

### Health Check
```
GET https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/health
```

### Database Test
```
GET https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/test-db
```

### Seed Demo Data
```
GET https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/seed/users
GET https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/seed/products
```

## Frontend Access
Your React frontend will be served at:
```
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/
```

## Troubleshooting

### If server doesn't start:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure MONGODB_URI is correct

### If database connection fails:
1. Check MongoDB connection string
2. Verify network access from Railway
3. Test with `/api/test-db` endpoint

### If frontend doesn't load:
1. Check if build completed successfully
2. Verify static file serving
3. Check Railway logs for build errors

## Monitoring
- Railway provides built-in monitoring
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Use health check endpoints for status

## Next Steps
1. Set up your environment variables in Railway
2. Test all endpoints
3. Configure your domain (optional)
4. Set up monitoring alerts

Your deployment should now be working perfectly! ðŸš€
